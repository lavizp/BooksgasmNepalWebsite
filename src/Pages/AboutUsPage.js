        BooksGasm was simply born out of the careful observation in the simple
        yet urgent problem of any scholar. We noticed that hundreds of
        used-books had to be dumped in the bookshelves after being read. That
        book could have been of a great significance to any other reader. But,
        due to the lack of connectivity and lack of a trusted party, the used
        book couldn’t find that other reader. Simply wasting a book with great
        academic and scholarly value was heartbreaking for the buyer and for we
        observers as well. We sought the solution. The seeking gave birth to the
        trusted third party seller, “ BooksGasm”. After months of research on
        the books of such a category and prospect, we launched our website,
        “Booksgasmnepal.com”. The founding members: Rahul Yadav, Reyan Kumar
        Sapkota, Prashant Yadav and Laviz Pandey, aim to encapsulate the agenda
        of Shared-Reading within the entire country. Business and monetary value
        is a secondary aspect of our initiative. Our primary goal is to match
        the used-book to the prospective buyer within a click of his finger, so
        that the book and the buyer’s longing to learn does not go in vain. The
        initiative also serves the Environment. Buying a used book at an
        arguable reasonable price serves the 3R policy (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle).
        Nevertheless, our goal is to ensure profit for both seller and buyer,
        and ensure that the value of a significantly relevant book does not die
        in a bookshelf. Furthermore, we try to become the best book providing
        online platform in the country for students of all levels here. We are
        here to make your learning journey much more easier here.
